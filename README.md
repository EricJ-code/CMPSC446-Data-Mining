# CMPSC446-Data-Mining
These are notes for Penn State Abington's CMPSC446 (Data Mining).
Feel free to read these it is mostly what was on the slides however, I have added links in the notes to useful resources
I highly reccomend using Obsidian to read the .md files, imo [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) makes it look cleaner plus headers are foldable.
